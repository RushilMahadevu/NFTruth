# 🔍 NFTruth - AI-Powered NFT Authenticity Detector (python base)

> *Fighting NFT scams with machine learning, one collection at a time!* 🚀


## 🎯 What is NFTruth?

NFTruth is an intelligent system that analyzes NFT collections to determine their legitimacy and detect potential scams. Using machine learning algorithms trained on market data, social signals, and blockchain metrics, it provides comprehensive risk assessments for NFT collections.

## 🧠 How The System Works

### 📊 Multi-Source Data Collection Pipeline

The system gathers comprehensive data from three major sources to build a complete picture of each NFT collection:

#### 🏪 **OpenSea API Integration**
```python
# Collection data extraction from opensea_collector.py
- Collection verification status (safelist_status)
- Trading statistics (volume, floor_price, market_cap)
- Social presence (Discord, Twitter links)
- Ownership metrics (total_supply, num_owners)
- Price dynamics (average_price, price changes)
```

#### 💬 **Reddit Social Intelligence**
```python
# Social sentiment analysis from reddit_collector.py
- Community mentions and engagement
- Sentiment analysis using VADER
- Scam keyword detection ("rugpull", "scam", "avoid")
- Hype indicator tracking ("moon", "diamond hands", "lfg")
- Discussion quality assessment
```

#### ⛓️ **Etherscan Blockchain Analysis**
```python
# Creator wallet analysis from etherscan_collector.py
- Wallet age and transaction history
- Suspicious transaction pattern detection
- Circular trading identification (wash trading)
- Creator balance and activity patterns
- Mint distribution analysis
```

### 🔬 Advanced Feature Engineering

Raw data is transformed into 20+ meaningful ML features through sophisticated engineering:

#### 💰 **Market Intelligence Features**
```python
# Liquidity and market efficiency indicators
volume_per_owner = total_volume / num_owners        # Liquidity quality
market_efficiency = market_cap / total_volume       # Market maturity  
price_premium = average_price / floor_price         # Pricing structure
whale_concentration = 1 - (num_owners / total_supply) # Ownership distribution
```

#### 📈 **Trading Pattern Analysis**
```python
# Volatility and trading behavior
avg_daily_volume = total_volume / collection_age_days
volume_volatility = std([1day, 7day, 30day volumes])
price_volatility = std([price changes over time])
wash_trading_score = circular_transactions / total_transactions
```

#### 🗣️ **Social Sentiment Scoring**
```python
# Community engagement metrics  
social_score = reddit_mentions + reddit_engagement
sentiment_analysis = VADER_compound_score
scam_keyword_density = scam_mentions / total_mentions
hype_indicator = hype_keywords / total_discussion
```

#### ⛓️ **Blockchain Forensics**
```python
# Creator wallet analysis
creator_wallet_age = days_since_first_transaction
suspicious_patterns = circular_trades + rapid_transactions
mint_distribution = uniformity_of_nft_distribution
creator_activity_score = transaction_frequency_analysis
```

### 🤖 Ensemble Machine Learning Architecture

Four specialized algorithms work together to detect authenticity patterns:

#### 🌳 **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Strength**: Handles complex feature interactions and mixed data types
- **Use Case**: Captures non-linear relationships between market metrics
- **Output**: Feature importance rankings + prediction confidence

#### 🚀 **Gradient Boosting Classifier** 
- **Strength**: Sequential learning builds strong patterns from weak signals
- **Use Case**: Detects subtle scam indicators through iterative improvement
- **Output**: Refined decision boundaries + prediction probability

#### 📈 **Logistic Regression**
- **Strength**: Interpretable linear relationships with feature scaling
- **Use Case**: Provides explainable risk factors and coefficients
- **Output**: Linear risk score + interpretable feature weights

#### 🎯 **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Strength**: Finds optimal decision boundaries in high-dimensional space
- **Use Case**: Separates legitimate from suspicious collections precisely
- **Output**: Maximum margin classification + support vector identification

### 🏷️ Intelligent Labeling System

Since NFT authenticity ground truth is rare, the system uses a sophisticated scoring methodology:

```python
# Legitimacy scoring algorithm
legitimacy_score = 0

# Verification signals (+3 points)
if collection.safelist_status == "verified": legitimacy_score += 3

# Social presence (+1 point each)
if collection.discord_url: legitimacy_score += 1
if collection.twitter_username: legitimacy_score += 1

# Market signals (+2 points each)  
if collection.floor_price > 0: legitimacy_score += 2
if collection.total_volume > 1000: legitimacy_score += 2

# Community signals (+1 point each)
if collection.num_owners > 1000: legitimacy_score += 1
if reddit_mentions > 0: legitimacy_score += 1

# Whitelist verification (+3 points)
if collection_slug in KNOWN_LEGITIMATE_COLLECTIONS: legitimacy_score += 3

# Final classification
is_legitimate = legitimacy_score >= 6  # Threshold optimization
```

### 🎯 Risk Assessment Framework

The system outputs comprehensive risk analysis:

```python
# Prediction pipeline output
{
    "collection": "collection-slug",
    "prediction": "Legitimate" | "Suspicious", 
    "confidence": {
        "legitimate": 0.847,    # 84.7% confidence
        "suspicious": 0.153     # 15.3% risk
    },
    "risk_score": 0.153,        # Inverse of legitimacy
    "risk_level": "Low",        # Categorical assessment
    "features_analyzed": {...}, # All extracted features
    "timestamp": "2025-06-18T..."
}
```
